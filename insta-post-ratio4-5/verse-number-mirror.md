Prompt: aspect_ratio="4:5"

(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A conceptual high-tech visualization of Data Refraction. A single stream of 48 Glowing Orbs flows into a crystalline Data Prism. As it exits, it splits into two beams: Top Beam (Blue) displays "25 ODD / 23 EVEN", Bottom Beam (Orange) displays "23 ODD / 25 EVEN".

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The prism glow fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the prism).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"Kur'an'da"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Ayet-Numara Aynası: 48 Sure Analizi"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Prismatic Cyan:

"• Filtre: Ayet sayısı > Konum olan sureleri tut."

"• Örnek: Sure 2 (286 ayet > 2) ✓ dahil."

"• Örnek: Sure 114 (6 ayet < 114) ✗ hariç."

"• Sonuç: [48] sure geçer. Konum paritesine göre: [25] tek, [23] çift."

"• Aynı 48'i (ayet−konum) paritesine göre: [23] tek, [25] çift."

"• Ayna takası: 25/23 olur 23/25. İki yöntem, ters sonuç."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"GÖZLEMLENEN SAYISAL DESENLER"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, laser-grid lighting, luxurious contrast between the glowing prism and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
