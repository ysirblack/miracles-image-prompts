Prompt: aspect_ratio="4:5"

(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A breathtaking, complex 3D Holographic Blueprint floating in a void. It consists of 114 Glowing Nodes arranged in a spherical lattice. Layers of Gold, Blue, and Silver lines visualize the interlocking patterns (Parity, Blocks, Sums) forming an unbreakable digital lock.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The holographic lattice fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the blueprint).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"Kur'an'da"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"114-Kod Mimarisi: Beş Sayısal Katman"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Holographic Prism Colors:

"• Katman 1: [Çekirdek Parite] (27/30/30/27 Simetrisi)."

"• Katman 2: [Çift Toplam] (6,236 Ayet Toplamı ile Eşleşir)."

"• Katman 3: [Uzun/Kısa Takası] (Ayna Yapısı)."

"• Katman 4: [Altı Blok] (Alternatif Ritim)."

"• Katman 5: [Ayet-Numara Aynası] (Filtreli Takas)."

"• Birleşik Durum: [Çok Boyutlu] Matematiksel Yapı."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"GÖZLEMLENEN SAYISAL DESENLER"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, "Master Code" lighting, luxurious contrast between the complex hologram and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
