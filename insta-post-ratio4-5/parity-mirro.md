Prompt: aspect_ratio="4:5"

(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A conceptual, high-fidelity visualization of Mathematical Reflection. Two towering, monolithic glass pillars stand on a reflective surface. The Left Pillar (Long) glows Gold showing "27 / 30". The Right Pillar (Short) glows Silver showing "30 / 27". Between them is a sharp gap labeled "The Missing 39".

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The reflective surface fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the pillars).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"PARİTE AYNASI"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Uzun vs. Kısa Sureler (27/30 Takası)"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Verified):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Reflective Chrome:

"• Kuran'ı Uzunluğa göre böl: [Uzun] (≥40) vs [Kısa] (<40)."

"• Sonuç: Tam [57 Uzun] ve [57 Kısa] sure."

"• Uzun Grup Paritesi: [27 Tek] / [30 Çift]."

"• Kısa Grup Paritesi: [30 Tek] / [27 Çift] (Mükemmel Takas)."

"• Neden 40'tan bölündü? Çünkü [39] ayetli hiçbir sure YOKTUR."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"İSTATİSTİKSEL DURUM: MÜKEMMEL SİMETRİK TERS ÇEVİRME"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, glass and reflection lighting, luxurious contrast between the pillars and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
