(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A breathtaking visualization of Temporal Duality. On the left, "الدُّنْيَا" (This World) appears as a [Warm Amber] glowing orb with earthly textures. On the right, "الْآخِرَة" (The Hereafter) appears as a [Celestial Blue] ethereal sphere with starlit radiance. The number "115" floats between them, perfectly centered.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The dual realms fade downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the visualization).
