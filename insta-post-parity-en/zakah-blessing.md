(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A spiritual visualization of Divine Economics. On the left, "زَكَاة" (Zakah) appears as [Golden Coins] flowing upward in a spiral of giving. On the right, "بَرَكَة" (Blessing) appears as [Radiant Light] showering down. The number "32" floats where the two streams meet, glowing in both colors.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The spiritual exchange fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the visualization).
