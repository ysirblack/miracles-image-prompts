(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A stunning visualization of Existential Duality. Two massive Arabic words hover in a dark void: "حَيَاة" (Life) glowing in [Verdant Green] with organic, flowing energy, and "مَوْت" (Death) glowing in [Ashen Grey] with fading, dissipating particles. Between them, the number "105" appears in both colors, merging at the center.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The dual energies fade downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the visualization).
