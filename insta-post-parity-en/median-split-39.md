(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A striking visualization of Perfect Division. A horizontal number line floats in a dark void, with 114 glowing dots representing surahs. They split perfectly at position 39-40, showing a visible gap at the boundary. Left side (57 dots) glows [Silver], right side (57 dots) glows [Gold]. The center shows an empty space marked "39" with no dot.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The number line fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the number line).
