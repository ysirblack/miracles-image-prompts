(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A stunning mirror visualization in a dark void. Two vertical bars face each other like a reflection. Left bar labeled "First 57" shows [28] in Cyan at top, [29] in Magenta below. Right bar labeled "Last 57" shows [29] in Cyan at top, [28] in Magenta below. Faint crossing lines connect 28↔28 and 29↔29, revealing the mirror swap pattern.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The mirrored bars fade downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the mirror visualization).

"• Perfect mirror symmetry: [28/29/29/28]."

"• Total homogeneous: 28+29 = [57]."

"• Total heterogeneous: 29+28 = [57]."
