(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A cosmic visualization of Statistical Impossibility. A massive glowing number "10^35" floats in a starfield void, with 23 smaller glowing nodes orbiting around it — each node representing one numerical pattern. The central number pulses with [Electric Blue] energy, while nodes glow in [Gold], [Silver], and [Teal] based on their tier.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The cosmic probability fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the visualization).

READ FIRST (Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"In the Qur'an"

READ SECOND (Subtitle):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Combined Probability: 23 Interlocking Patterns"

READ LAST (The List):
A bold, legible list using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Cosmic Blue.

"• Total patterns analyzed: [23]."

"• Tier 1 (Robust): [5] patterns pass strictest tests."

"• Combined probability: ~[1 in 10^35]."

"• Context: Atoms in human body ≈ [10^28]."

"• More patterns than atoms can explain."

"• Statistical conclusion: Not random chance."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"OBSERVED NUMERICAL PATTERNS"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, cosmic statistical lighting, luxurious contrast between the probability visualization and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
