(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): An abstract visualization of mathematical combination. Two streams of numbers (6555 and 6236) flow from opposite sides of the void, merging into a brilliant [Prime Gold] explosion at the center where "12791" and "209029" emerge. The separate streams glow [Dim Grey] while the combined primes radiate [Luminous Gold].

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The numerical streams fade downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the visualization).

READ FIRST (Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"In the Qur'an"

READ SECOND (Subtitle):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Prime Emergence: When Sums Combine"

READ LAST (The List):
A bold, legible list using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Prime Gold.

"• Sum of positions (1-114): [6555] — Not prime."

"• Sum of verses: [6236] — Not prime."

"• Sum of (position + verses): [12791] — PRIME."

"• Sum of (position × verses): [209029] — PRIME."

"• Neither individual sum is prime."

"• Both combined operations yield primes."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"OBSERVED NUMERICAL PATTERNS"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, dual-stream convergence lighting, luxurious contrast between merging numbers and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
