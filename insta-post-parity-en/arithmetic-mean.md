(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A celestial balance scale floating in a dark void. On the left pan, 41 glowing orbs cluster together in [Amber Gold]. On the right pan, 73 glowing orbs cluster in [Sapphire Blue]. The fulcrum shows "54.7" as the balance point. Both numbers "41" and "73" float above their respective pans with a subtle prime number symbol (★).

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The balance scale fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the scale).
