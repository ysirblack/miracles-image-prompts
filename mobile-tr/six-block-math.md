Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A stunning, abstract 3D visualization of Mathematical Rhythm. Six towering, translucent Data Monoliths stand in a row, numbered 1 through 6. Inside, glowing nodes represent the 19 chapters. The pillars glow in a perfect alternating pattern (Gold-Silver-Gold...), visualizing the "Odd-Even" heartbeat.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The rhythmic glow fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the monoliths).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"ALTI BLOK SENFONİSİ"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"114 Sure ÷ 19'lu 6 Blok"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Verified):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Rhythmic Violet:

"• Metni her biri [19 Surelik] [6 Bloğa] ayır."

"• 3 Sistem Uygula: [Parite], [Homojenlik] & [Asallar]."

"• Sonuç: Tüm bloklarda Mükemmel [Alternatif Desenler]."

"• Örnek: [Tek-Çift-Tek-Çift-Tek-Çift] dizileri."

"• Koordine edilmiş çok boyutlu matematiksel bir kilit."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"İSTATİSTİKSEL İHTİMAL: ~29,412'DE 1 (BİRLEŞİK)"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, "Symphony of Light" aesthetic, luxurious contrast between the glowing pillars and black data pane, clean and sophisticated.
