Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A stunning, high-tech abstract data visualization. A glowing grid of 114 Nodes (representing chapters) arranged in a perfect symmetrical pattern. The nodes are color-coded in four distinct soft neon hues to represent the groups (27, 30, 30, 27), creating a visual sense of balance in a dark void.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The glowing grid fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the grid).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"PARİTE SİMETRİSİ"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"114 Surelik Matematiksel Denge"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Verified):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Geometric Indigo:

"• Toplam Sure: [114] (57 Tek / 57 Çift olarak mükemmel bölünür)."

"• Homojen Çiftler (Tek-Tek / Çift-Çift) = [57]."

"• Heterojen Çiftler (Tek-Çift / Çift-Tek) = [57]."

"• Çeyrekler: [27] / [30] / [30] / [27] (İç İçe Simetri)."

"• İstatistiksel olarak [Beklenen] ama zarif bir denge yapısı."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"İSTATİSTİKSEL DURUM: DOĞAL MATEMATİKSEL UYUM"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, digital data lighting, luxurious contrast between the glowing grid and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
