Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A conceptual high-tech visualization of Data Refraction. A single stream of 48 Glowing Orbs flows into a crystalline Data Prism. As it exits, it splits into two beams: Top Beam (Blue) displays "25 ODD / 23 EVEN", Bottom Beam (Orange) displays "23 ODD / 25 EVEN".

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The prism glow fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the prism).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"AYET-NUMARA AYNASI"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Filtrelenmiş 48 Surelik Takas"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Verified):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Prismatic Cyan:

"• FİLTRE: Sadece [Ayet Sayısı > Sure No] olan sureleri tut."

"• VERİ SETİ: Tam olarak [48 Sure] bu kurala uyar."

"• ANALİZ A (Sure No): [25 Tek] / [23 Çift] bulundu."

"• ANALİZ B (Fark): [23 Tek] / [25 Çift] bulundu."

"• SONUÇ: Bağımsız yöntemler arasında mükemmel bir [Sayısal Takas]."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"İSTATİSTİKSEL İHTİMAL: ~439'DA 1 (%0.23)"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, laser-grid lighting, luxurious contrast between the glowing prism and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
