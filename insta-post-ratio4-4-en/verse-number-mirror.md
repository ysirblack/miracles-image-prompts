(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A conceptual high-tech visualization of Data Refraction. A single stream of 48 Glowing Orbs flows into a crystalline Data Prism. As it exits, it splits into two beams: Top Beam (Blue) displays "25 ODD / 23 EVEN", Bottom Beam (Orange) displays "23 ODD / 25 EVEN".

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The prism glow fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the prism).

A bold, legible list using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Prismatic Cyan.

"• Filter: Keep surahs where Verses > Position."

"• Example: Surah 2 (286 verses > 2) ✓ included."

"• Example: Surah 114 (6 verses < 114) ✗ excluded."

"• Result: [48] surahs pass. Classify by position parity: [25] odd, [23] even."

"• Classify same 48 by (verses−position) parity: [23] odd, [25] even."

"• Mirror swap: 25/23 becomes 23/25. Two methods, swapped result."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"OBSERVED NUMERICAL PATTERNS"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, laser-grid lighting, luxurious contrast between the glowing prism and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
