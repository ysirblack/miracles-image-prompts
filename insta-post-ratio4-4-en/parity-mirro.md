(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A conceptual, high-fidelity visualization of Mathematical Reflection. Two towering, monolithic glass pillars stand on a reflective surface. The Left Pillar (Long) glows Gold showing "27 / 30". The Right Pillar (Short) glows Silver showing "30 / 27". Between them is a sharp gap labeled "The Missing 39".

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The reflective surface fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the pillars).

READ FIRST (Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"In the Qur'an"

READ SECOND (Subtitle):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Parity Mirror: Long vs. Short Surahs"

READ LAST (The List):
A bold, legible list using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Reflective Chrome.

"• Divide by length: Long (≥40 verses) vs Short (≤38 verses)."

"• Example: Surah 3 (200 verses) = Long. Surah 114 (6 verses) = Short."

"• Result: [57] Long surahs, [57] Short surahs. No surah has 39 verses!"

"• Long group by position: [27] at odd positions, [30] at even."

"• Short group by position: [30] at odd, [27] at even — Mirror swap!"

"• Pattern: 27/30 ↔ 30/27. Numbers swap between groups."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"OBSERVED NUMERICAL PATTERNS"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, glass and reflection lighting, luxurious contrast between the pillars and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
