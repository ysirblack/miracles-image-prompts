A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A spectacular scientific visualization of Earth's Magnetosphere. A glowing Blue Magnetic Shield surrounds Earth, actively deflecting a stream of Burning Orange Solar Wind. It visually looks like a "Ceiling" protecting the world.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The solar wind fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the magnetic field).
