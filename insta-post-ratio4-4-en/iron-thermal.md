(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A dramatic, high-contrast macro shot of Red-Hot Iron on a forge. It is in the state of being "made pliable"—glowing intense orange-white and emitting sparks.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The industrial glow fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the metal).

A bold, legible list using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Forge Fire Orange.
