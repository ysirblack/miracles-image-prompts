(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A conceptual visualization of Genetic Balance. Suspended in a dark void are two glowing Arabic words: "رَجُل" (Man) in [Cyan] and "ٱمْرَأَة" (Woman) in [Magenta]. Between them, a stylized DNA double helix with "23" glowing on each strand.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The glowing text fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the calligraphy).
