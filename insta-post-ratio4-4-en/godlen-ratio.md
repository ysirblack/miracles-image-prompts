(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A stunning, high-fidelity visualization of the Golden Ratio (φ). A glowing Nautilus Shell or Fibonacci Spiral constructed of golden light. The number 1.618... overlays the spiral, with decimals trailing off into infinity.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The spiral geometry fades downwards into a clean, deep Mathematical Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the spiral).
