(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A high-fidelity scientific visualization of "Structured Genesis." Rising from raw Clay/Earth (Turab/Tin) at the base of the visual section is a glowing Hexagonal Lattice (Carbon structure). Inside the hexagons, DNA strands begin to form, bridging matter to life.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The geometric lattice fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the lattice).

READ FIRST (Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"In the Qur'an"

READ SECOND (Subtitle):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Chemical & Biological Numerical Patterns"

READ LAST (The List):
A bold, legible list using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Carbon-Life Green.

"• Humans are created from [Clay] (Carbon-based life)."

"• Carbon Mass Number is [12]. Word 'Clay' (Tin) appears exactly [12] times."

"• Carbon Atomic Number is [6]. Matches the [6] stages of creation."

"• Human DNA consists of [23] pairs of chromosomes."

"• Interval between mentions of 'Spirit' (Nefha) relates to [23 x 23]."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"OBSERVED NUMERICAL PATTERNS"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, "Intelligent Design" lighting, luxurious contrast between the geometric lattice and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
