(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A stunning, high-fidelity scientific visualization of the Helical Solar System Model. The Sun moves rapidly forward, while Earth and other planets spiral around its path, creating glowing DNA-like Trails.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The star trails fade seamlessly downwards into a clean, deep Galactic Void, allowing for perfect text readability.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the helix).

"• Planetary orbits trace [Helixes] (Spirals) through space."

"• Matches the [Fluid Dynamics] of cosmic motion."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"OBSERVED NUMERICAL PATTERNS"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, motion-blur accents on the trails, luxurious contrast between the glowing helix and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
