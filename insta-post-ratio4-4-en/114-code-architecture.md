(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A breathtaking, complex 3D Holographic Blueprint floating in a void. It consists of 114 Glowing Nodes arranged in a spherical lattice. Layers of Gold, Blue, and Silver lines visualize the interlocking patterns (Parity, Blocks, Sums) forming an unbreakable digital lock.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The holographic lattice fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the blueprint).

READ FIRST (Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"In the Qur'an"

READ SECOND (Subtitle):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"114-Code Architecture: Five Numerical Layers"

READ LAST (The List):
A bold, legible list using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Holographic Prism Colors.

"• Layer 1: [Core Parity] (27/30/30/27 Symmetry)."

"• Layer 2: [Even Sum] (Matches 6,236 Total Verses)."

"• Layer 3: [Long/Short Swap] (Mirror Structure)."

"• Layer 4: [Six Block] (Alternating Rhythm)."

"• Layer 5: [Verse-Number Mirror] (Filtered Swap)."

"• Combined State: A [Multi-Dimensional] Mathematical Structure."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"OBSERVED NUMERICAL PATTERNS"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, "Master Code" lighting, luxurious contrast between the complex hologram and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
