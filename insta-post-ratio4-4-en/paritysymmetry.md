(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A stunning, high-tech abstract data visualization. A glowing grid of 114 Nodes (representing chapters) arranged in a perfect symmetrical pattern. The nodes are color-coded in four distinct soft neon hues to represent the groups (27, 30, 30, 27), creating a visual sense of balance in a dark void.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The glowing grid fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the grid).

"• Mathematical balance structure."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
