(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A spectacular, high-fidelity scientific visualization of the Big Bang. A blindingly bright point of infinite density (The Singularity) is in the precise moment of "Ripping Apart," sending massive shockwaves outward.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The exploding light fades seamlessly downwards into the deep, cooling darkness of the early universe, creating a clean Cosmic Vignette for the text.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the explosion).
