(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A spectacular visualization of the Early Universe. The scene is filled with thick, swirling, glowing Primordial Gas and Dust that looks exactly like "Smoke"—hot, opaque, and voluminous (deep oranges/reds).

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The swirling cosmic smoke fades seamlessly downwards into a deep, clean Nebular Void, creating a dark canvas for the text.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the smoke).
