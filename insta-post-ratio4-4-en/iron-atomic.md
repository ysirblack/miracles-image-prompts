(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A high-tech, 3D scientific visualization of an Iron Atom. The nucleus glows with [26 Protons] and [31 Neutrons], surrounded by orbiting electron shells against a faint starfield.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The atomic glow fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the atom).
