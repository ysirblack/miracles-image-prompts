(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A conceptual, high-fidelity visualization of "The Unanswered Pen." An exquisite Arabic Calligraphy Pen (Qalam) rests on a stand under dramatic light. A single drop of golden ink hangs frozen from the tip, symbolizing the inability to write a response.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The scene fades downwards into a clean, deep Library/Study Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the pen).
