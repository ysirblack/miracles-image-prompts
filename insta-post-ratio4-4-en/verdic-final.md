(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A stunning, conceptual visualization of "The Architected Code." The ancient manuscript lies open, with the Holographic Lattice rising upwards, filling the upper section with complex data nodes.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The holographic glow fades seamlessly downwards into a clean, deep Data Void, creating a massive pitch-black canvas at the bottom.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the hologram).

READ FIRST (Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):

READ SECOND (Subtitle):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Architectural Code: Data Integrity and Structure"

READ LAST (The List):
A bold, legible list using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Terminal Green.

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"OBSERVED NUMERICAL PATTERNS"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, "Matrix" style data lighting, luxurious contrast between the top hologram and bottom black void, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
