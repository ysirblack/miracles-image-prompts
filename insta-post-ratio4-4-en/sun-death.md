(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A haunting, high-fidelity scientific visualization of the Death of the Sun. It is a dying, deep red/brown orb, shrinking and collapsing inward with dark nebular clouds "wrapping" around it.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The darkening cosmos fades seamlessly downwards into a deep, absolute Entropy Void, creating a pitch-black canvas for the text.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the dying sun).
