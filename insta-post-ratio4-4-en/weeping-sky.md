(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A stunning, high-fidelity archaeological visualization of an Ancient Egyptian Tomb Wall. Weathered limestone is covered in Hieroglyphs (The Pyramid Texts). One section glows faintly in spectral gold, while a subtle Quranic overlay appears to "cancel" it out.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The stone texture fades downwards into a clean, deep Desert Night Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the wall).

READ FIRST (Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):

READ SECOND (Subtitle):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Weeping Sky: Surah Ad-Dukhan 44:29"

READ LAST (The List):
A bold, legible list using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Pharaonic Gold.

"• Ancient Belief: 'The sky weeps for you' (Pyramid Texts)."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
