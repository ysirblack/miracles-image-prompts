(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A conceptual, high-fidelity visualization of Perfect Equilibrium. A majestic, ancient Golden Scale is suspended in a dark void. The Left Pan holds a glowing orb (Titles/Rasul), and the Right Pan holds a matching orb (Names). The needle is perfectly centered.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The scale fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the scale).

READ FIRST (Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):

READ SECOND (Subtitle):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Prophet Balance: Messenger Titles vs. Prophet Names"

READ LAST (The List):
A bold, legible list using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Balanced Emerald Green.

"• Total 'Messenger' (Rasul) Titles = exactly [510]."

"• Total 'Prophet' Names = exactly [510]."

"• Ratio throughout the text is [1:1]."

"• Method: [Name-to-Name] counting."

"• 'Messages' (Objects) and 'Ahmad' excluded."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"OBSERVED NUMERICAL PATTERNS"
