(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A stunning, abstract 3D visualization of Mathematical Rhythm. Six towering, translucent Data Monoliths stand in a row, numbered 1 through 6. Inside, glowing nodes represent the 19 chapters. The pillars glow in a perfect alternating pattern (Gold-Silver-Gold...), visualizing the "Odd-Even" heartbeat.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The rhythmic glow fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the monoliths).

READ FIRST (Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"In the Qur'an"

READ SECOND (Subtitle):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Six Block Math: 114 Surahs ÷ 6 Blocks"

READ LAST (The List):
A bold, legible list using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Rhythmic Violet.

"• Method: 114 surahs ÷ 6 = [19 surahs] per block."

"• Block 1: Surahs 1-19. Block 2: Surahs 20-38. And so on."

"• Count 'homogeneous' surahs (position & verse same parity)."

"• Results per block: [11], [12], [5], [8], [9], [12]."

"• Pattern alternates: High→High→Low→Low→Low→High."

"• 7 different metrics show coordinated alternation (p=0.000034)."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"OBSERVED NUMERICAL PATTERNS"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, "Symphony of Light" aesthetic, luxurious contrast between the glowing pillars and black data pane, clean and sophisticated.
