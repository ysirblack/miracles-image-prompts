(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A mesmerizing, abstract 3D visualization of Mathematical Harmony. Two glowing streams of digital numbers—one [Gold] (Even sums) and one [Silver] (Odd sums)—spiral around each other like a Double Helix, ascending into a void.

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The spiral code fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the helix).

READ FIRST (Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"In the Qur'an"

READ SECOND (Subtitle):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Odd & Even Sums: Surah Number + Verse Count"

READ LAST (The List):
A bold, legible list using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Harmonic Gold.

"• Method: Position + Verses = Sum for each surah."

"• Example: Surah 2 → 2+286=[288] (Even). Surah 3 → 3+200=[203] (Odd)."

"• Result: [57] surahs have even sums, [57] have odd sums."

"• Even-sum surahs contain [6,236] verses — the entire Qur'an!"

"• Odd-sum surahs contain [6,555] verses (=1+2+3+...+114)."

"• The even group's verses = total book. Mathematical checksum."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"OBSERVED NUMERICAL PATTERNS"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, elegant data visualization lighting, luxurious contrast between the spiral code and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
