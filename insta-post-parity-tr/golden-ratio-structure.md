(1) The Vertical Layout (40/60 Split):
A single, cohesive 4:5 cinematic vertical shot (Instagram Feed ratio).

Visual Anchor (Top 40%): A mesmerizing Golden Spiral (Fibonacci) constructed from glowing mathematical data. On one spiral arm, "7,906" glows in [Amber Gold] representing repeated sums. On the other arm, "4,885" glows in [Silver] representing unique sums. At the center where they meet, "φ = 1.618" radiates [Brilliant White].

Negative Space (Bottom 60%): The spiral geometry fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 60% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the spiral).

READ FIRST (Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"Kur'an'da"

READ SECOND (Subtitle):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Altın Oran: Ayet Yapısında Gizli"

READ LAST (The List):
A bold, legible list using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Phi Gold.

"• Yöntem: Konum + Ayet = Toplam (örn: Sure 1: 1+7=[8])."

"• Tekrar örneği: Sure 10 (10+109=[119]) & Sure 20 (20+99=[119])."

"• Tekil örnek: Sure 1 (1+7=[8]) — başka sure 8'e ulaşmıyor."

"• Tekrar eden grup: [74] sure, toplam [7.906] ayet."

"• Tekil grup: [40] sure, toplam [4.885] ayet."

"• Oran: 7906÷4885 = [1,618] ≈ Altın Oran φ."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"GÖZLEMLENEN SAYISAL DESENLER"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, divine proportion lighting with golden spiral radiance, luxurious contrast between the mathematical geometry and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
