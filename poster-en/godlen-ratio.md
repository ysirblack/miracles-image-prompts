Prompt: aspect_ratio="16:9"
(1) The Wide Layout:
A single, cohesive 16:9 cinematic shot.

Visual Anchor (Left): A stunning, high-fidelity visualization of the Golden Ratio ($\phi$) in Nature.
The Subject: A glowing Nautilus Shell or a Fibonacci Spiral in a sunflower/galaxy, constructed of golden light.
The Number: The number 1.618... is overlaid on the spiral, but the decimals trails off into infinity, fading into the distance or becoming smaller and smaller, visually representing an "Uncountable" sequence.
Negative Space (Right): The spiral geometry fades seamlessly to the right into a clean, deep Mathematical Void, creating a dark canvas for the text.
(2) Text Hierarchy (Right Side - Floating in Negative Space):
The text is aligned LEFT within the right-hand negative space using premium editorial typography.

READ FIRST (Top - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):"THE GOLDEN RATIO CODE"
READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):"Surah 16:18 (The Uncountable Infinite)"
READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Mathematical Infinity):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Phi Golden Ratio:
"• The Golden Ratio ($\phi$) is approx [1.618]."
"• Verse [16:18] states: 'If you try to count... you cannot'."
"• Phi is an [Irrational Number] with infinite decimals."
"• It is mathematically impossible to [Enumerate] the end of Phi."
"• The Verse content matches the [Infinite Nature] of the number."
THE FOOTER (Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:"STATISTICAL STATUS: PERFECT NUMERICAL & SEMANTIC ALIGNMENT"
(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K documentary quality, incredibly sharp typography, "Divine Proportion" lighting, luxurious contrast between the glowing geometry and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
