Prompt: aspect_ratio="16:9"
(1) The Wide Split Layout:
A sophisticated cinematic composition divided sharply down the center.

LEFT SIDE: A conceptual, high-fidelity visualization of Divine Similitude.
In the center, a vertical mirror interface divides two textures.
Left Half: A sculpted surface of Red Clay (Adam). Floating text "آدم" (3 Letters) connects via a glowing line to "Surah 3: Al-Imran".
Right Half: An ethereal surface of White Light (Jesus). Floating text "عيسى" (4 Letters) connects via a glowing line to "Surah 4: An-Nisa".
The two halves unite to point to a central node: "Surah 25".
RIGHT SIDE: A clean, matte Deep Obsidian background.
(2) Right Panel Text & Hierarchy:
The text is aligned LEFT within the right panel using premium editorial typography.

In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):"THE ADAM & JESUS BALANCE"
READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):"Similarity in Creation (Surah 3:59)"
READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Structural Depth):
