Prompt: aspect_ratio="16:9"
(1) The Wide Layout:
A single, cohesive 16:9 cinematic shot.

Visual Anchor (Left): A majestic, deep-space visualization of the Cosmic Web. Brilliant galaxies and nebulae are connected by filaments of light, but they are clearly moving outward from a central point. A subtle "Redshift" effect (shifting from blue to red) on the distant galaxies visualizes the physics of expansion and velocity.
Negative Space (Right): The deep starfield extends seamlessly to the right, fading into a clean, dark Cosmic Void. There is no hard line; just a natural gradient into deep shadow to allow for perfect text readability.
(2) Text Hierarchy (Right Side - Floating in Negative Space):
The text is aligned LEFT within the right-hand negative space using premium editorial typography.
