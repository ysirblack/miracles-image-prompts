Prompt: aspect_ratio="16:9"
(1) The Wide Layout:
A single, cohesive 16:9 cinematic shot.

Visual Anchor (Left): A spectacular, high-fidelity scientific visualization of the Big Bang.
Center: A blindingly bright point of infinite density (The Singularity/Ratqan) in pure White-Gold.
Action: It is in the precise moment of "Ripping Apart" (Fataqa). Massive shockwaves of primordial energy and gas are exploding outward, creating the fabric of Space (Heavens) and the precursors of Matter (Earth).
Visual Metaphor: The image looks like a single, woven fabric of light being powerfully torn open.
Negative Space (Right): The exploding light fades seamlessly to the right into the deep, cooling darkness of the early universe, creating a clean Cosmic Vignette for the text.
(2) Text Hierarchy (Right Side - Floating in Negative Space):
The text is aligned LEFT within the right-hand negative space using premium editorial typography.

READ FIRST (Top - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):"THE BIG BANG CODE"
READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):"Surah 21:30 (The Cosmic Singularity)"
READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Linguistic Precision):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Primordial Gold:
"• Verse states Heavens & Earth were a [Joined Entity] (Ratqan)."
"• Then We [Separated/Ripped] them apart (Fataqnahuma)."
"• Matches the [Initial Singularity] of the Big Bang."
"• All matter and space were once [One Fused Mass]."
"• 1,300 years before [Lemaître] proposed the 'Primeval Atom'."
THE FOOTER (Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:"SCIENTIFIC STATUS: STANDARD COSMOLOGICAL MODEL"
(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K documentary quality, incredibly sharp typography, explosive high-energy lighting, luxurious contrast between the blinding light and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
