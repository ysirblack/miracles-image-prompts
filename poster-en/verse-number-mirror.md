Prompt: aspect_ratio="16:9"
(1) The Wide Split Layout:
A sophisticated cinematic composition divided sharply down the center.

LEFT SIDE: A conceptual high-tech visualization of Data Refraction. A single stream of 48 Glowing Orbs (representing the filtered chapters) flows into a crystalline Data Prism.
As the stream exits the prism, it splits into two distinct beams.
Top Beam (Blue): A holographic counter displays "25 ODD / 23 EVEN".
Bottom Beam (Orange): A holographic counter displays "23 ODD / 25 EVEN".
The visual clearly shows the numbers are physically swapping positions.
RIGHT SIDE: A clean, matte Deep Obsidian background.
(2) Right Panel Text & Hierarchy:
The text is aligned LEFT within the right panel using premium editorial typography.

In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):"THE VERSE-NUMBER MIRROR"
READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):"The Filtered 48-Chapter Swap"
READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Verified):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Prismatic Cyan:
"• FILTER: Keep only chapters where [Verses > Chapter No]."
"• DATASET: Exactly [48 Chapters] qualify."
"• ANALYSIS A (Chapter No): Found [25 Odd] / [23 Even]."
"• ANALYSIS B (Difference): Found [23 Odd] / [25 Even]."
"• CONCLUSION: A perfect [Numerical Inversion] pattern."
THE FOOTER (Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:"STATISTICAL PROBABILITY: ~1 IN 439 (0.23%)"
(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K documentary quality, incredibly sharp typography, laser-grid lighting, luxurious contrast between the glowing prism and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
