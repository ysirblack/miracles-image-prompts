Prompt: aspect_ratio="16:9"
(1) The Wide Layout:
A single, cohesive 16:9 cinematic shot.

Visual Anchor (Left): A spectacular geological cross-section of a Mountain Range (like the Himalayas).
Above Surface: Majestic, snow-capped peaks rise high into the sky.
Below Surface: The crust is cut away to reveal massive, deep Mountain Roots extending far down into the glowing, semi-molten Mantle.
The Metaphor: The visual shape clearly resembles a "Peg" or "Tooth"—with much more mass below ground than above, anchoring the crust.
Negative Space (Right): The geological layers fade seamlessly to the right into a deep, clean Subterranean Vignette, creating a dark canvas for the text.
(2) Text Hierarchy (Right Side - Floating in Negative Space):
The text is aligned LEFT within the right-hand negative space using premium editorial typography.

READ FIRST (Top - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):"THE MOUNTAIN ROOTS CODE"
READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):"Surah 78:7 ('Mountains as Pegs')"
READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Geological Isostasy):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Granite Grey/Gold:
"• Verse describes Mountains as [Awtad] (Pegs/Stakes)."
"• A Tent Peg is mostly buried [Underground] to hold firm."
"• Geology confirms Mountains have deep [Roots] in the Mantle."
"• Roots can be [15x Deeper] than the visible height."
"• This phenomenon (Isostasy) [Stabilizes] the Earth's crust."
THE FOOTER (Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:"SCIENTIFIC STATUS: CONFIRMED GEOLOGICAL ISOSTASY"
(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K documentary quality, incredibly sharp typography, geological cross-section lighting, luxurious contrast between the layered earth and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
