A single, cohesive 16:9 cinematic shot.

Visual Anchor (Left): A dramatic, high-fidelity historical visualization of the Byzantine Counter-Offensive.
The Scene: Roman Legions are rallying at dawn in a desert canyon (representing the "nearest land"), holding tattered purple banners that are catching the rising sun.
The Contrast: The scene transitions from the shadow of defeat (foreground ruins) to the light of victory (marching troops).
The Overlay: A glowing golden timeline graphic arcs over the scene, marking the start point "615 CE (Defeat)" and the end point "627 CE (Victory)," with the span labeled "3-9 YEARS".
Negative Space (Right): The desert landscape fades seamlessly to the right into a clean, deep Historical Vignette, creating a dark canvas for the text.
