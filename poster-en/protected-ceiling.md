Prompt: aspect_ratio="16:9"
(1) The Wide Layout:
A single, cohesive 16:9 cinematic shot.

Visual Anchor (Left): A spectacular scientific visualization of Earth's Magnetosphere.
Earth is visible on the far left.
Surrounding it is a glowing, translucent Blue Magnetic Shield (The Van Allen Belts).
This shield is actively deflecting a stream of Burning Orange Solar Wind and cosmic radiation, preventing it from hitting the planet. It visually looks like a "Ceiling" protecting the world below.
Negative Space (Right): The stream of solar wind fades out into the quiet darkness of space on the right, creating a clean, deep Cosmic Vignette for the text.
(2) Text Hierarchy (Right Side - Floating in Negative Space):
The text is aligned LEFT within the right-hand negative space using premium editorial typography.

READ FIRST (Top - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):"THE PROTECTED CEILING"
READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):"Surah 21:32 ('Saqfan Mahfūẓan')"
READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Dual Shielding):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Shield Cyan:

"• [Atmosphere]: Filters UV rays and burns meteors."
"• [Magnetosphere]: Deflects lethal Solar Wind."
"• Van Allen Belts act as an invisible [Force Field]."
"• Without this shield, life on Earth would be [Impossible]."
THE FOOTER (Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:"SCIENTIFIC STATUS: CONFIRMED PLANETARY SHIELDING"
(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K documentary quality, incredibly sharp typography, high-contrast lighting (Orange Solar Wind vs Blue Magnetic Field), luxurious aesthetic.
