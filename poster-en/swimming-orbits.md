Prompt: aspect_ratio="16:9"
(1) The Wide Layout:
A single, cohesive 16:9 cinematic shot.

Visual Anchor (Left): A stunning, high-fidelity scientific visualization of the Helical Solar System Model.
Leading: The Sun is moving rapidly forward (left to right) like a comet head.
Trailing: The Earth and other planets are spiraling around the Sun's path, creating beautiful, glowing DNA-like Trails or corkscrews behind it.
The Motion: It does not look like a flat disk; it looks like a dynamic system "swimming" or "gliding" through the deep galactic fluid.
Negative Space (Right): The star trails fade seamlessly to the right into a clean, deep Galactic Void, allowing for perfect text readability.
(2) Text Hierarchy (Right Side - Floating in Negative Space):
The text is aligned LEFT within the right-hand negative space using premium editorial typography.

READ FIRST (Top - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):"THE SWIMMING ORBITS"
READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):"Surah 21:33 ('Yasbahūn' - They Swim)"
READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Celestial Fluidity):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Fluid Motion Cyan:
"• Verse describes celestial bodies as [Swimming] (Yasbahūn)."
"• Implies motion through a medium, not static rotation."
"• The Sun is not fixed; it [Orbits] the Galactic Center."
"• Planetary orbits trace [Helixes] (Spirals) through space."
"• Matches the [Fluid Dynamics] of cosmic motion."
THE FOOTER (Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:"SCIENTIFIC STATUS: CONFIRMED GALACTIC MECHANICS"
(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K documentary quality, incredibly sharp typography, motion-blur accents on the trails, luxurious contrast between the glowing helix and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
