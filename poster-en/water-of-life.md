Prompt: aspect_ratio="16:9"
(1) The Wide Layout:
A single, cohesive 16:9 cinematic shot.

Visual Anchor (Left): A breathtaking, high-fidelity microscopic visualization of Cellular Biology.
The Subject: A single, translucent Living Cell suspended in a pristine fluid medium.
The Detail: Inside the cell, the Cytoplasm is glowing and fluid-like, clearly visualizing that the structure is primarily water. Subtle, stylized streams of H₂O Molecules are shown flowing through the membrane, fueling the glowing biological machinery inside.
The Vibe: It looks like a "Universe in a Drop," emphasizing water as the medium of existence.
Negative Space (Right): The fluid environment fades seamlessly to the right into a clean, deep Aquatic/Abyssal Vignette, allowing for perfect text readability.
