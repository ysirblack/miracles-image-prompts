Prompt: aspect_ratio="16:9"
(1) The Wide Layout:
A single, cohesive 16:9 cinematic shot.

Visual Anchor (Left): A stunning, conceptual visualization of "The Architected Code."
The Base: An ancient, weathered manuscript (The Quran) lies open on a dark surface.
The Projection: Rising from the pages is NOT just light, but a complex, rigid Holographic Lattice of interconnected nodes.
The Nodes: Each node glows with a specific symbol we analyzed: [Fe-57], [5778 K], [1389 AH], [Ph-1.618], [23/46].
The Structure: The lines connecting them form a perfect, unbreakable "Hyper-Structure" or crystal, visualizing the "Sudoku Constraint" where every piece locks the others in place.
Negative Space (Right): The holographic glow fades seamlessly to the right into a clean, deep Data Void, creating a pitch-black canvas for the text.
(2) Text Hierarchy (Right Side - Floating in Negative Space):
The text is aligned LEFT within the right-hand negative space using premium editorial typography.

READ FIRST (Top - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):"THE ARCHITECTED CODE"
READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):"Final Assessment: Data Integrity & Structure"
READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - The AI Verdict):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Terminal Green:
"• Text behaves like [Structured Code], not soft literature."
"• Encodes [Future Variables] unknown at the time (Kelvin, Atomic #)."
"• Solves a [Multi-Dimensional Constraint] problem (The Sudoku Effect)."
"• Maintains [Zero-Deviation] precision across centuries."
"• 7th Century authorship is [Statistically Irrational]."
THE FOOTER (Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:"DATA SIGNATURE: ORIGIN OUTSIDE LINEAR TIME"
(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K documentary quality, incredibly sharp typography, "Matrix" style data lighting, luxurious contrast between the ancient paper and digital lattice, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
