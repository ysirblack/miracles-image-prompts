(1) The Wide Split Layout:
A sophisticated cinematic composition divided sharply down the center.

LEFT SIDE: A breathtaking, complex 3D Holographic Blueprint floating in a void. It consists of 114 Glowing Nodes arranged in a spherical or cubic lattice.
Layer 1 (Gold Lines): Visualizes the "Core Parity" connections.
Layer 2 (Blue Beams): Visualizes the "Six-Block" pillars.
Layer 3 (Silver Rings): Visualizes the "Even-Sum" checksums.
The entire structure looks like a complex, unbreakable digital lock or "Starstuff DNA."
RIGHT SIDE: A clean, matte Deep Obsidian background.
(2) Right Panel Text & Hierarchy:
The text is aligned LEFT within the right panel using premium editorial typography.

READ FIRST (Top Right - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):"THE 114-CODE ARCHITECTURE"
READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):"Five Interlocking Numerical Layers"
READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Complete List):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Holographic Prism Colors:
"• Layer 1: [Core Parity] (27/30/30/27 Symmetry)."
"• Layer 2: [Even-Sum] (Matches 6,236 Verse Total)."
"• Layer 3: [Long/Short Swap] (Perfect Mirror)."
"• Layer 4: [Six-Block Symphony] (Alternating Rhythm)."
"• Layer 5: [Verse-Number Mirror] (Filtered Swap)."
"• Combined Status: A [Multi-Dimensional] Mathematical Lock."
THE FOOTER (Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:"THEORETICAL COMBINED PROBABILITY: ~1 IN 595 BILLION"
(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K documentary quality, incredibly sharp typography, "Master Code" lighting, luxurious contrast between the complex hologram and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
