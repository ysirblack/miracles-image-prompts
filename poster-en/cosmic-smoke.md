Prompt: aspect_ratio="16:9"
(1) The Wide Layout:
A single, cohesive 16:9 cinematic shot.

Visual Anchor (Left): A spectacular, high-fidelity scientific visualization of the Early Universe (The Cosmic Dawn).
The Texture: The scene is filled with thick, swirling, glowing Primordial Gas and Dust. It looks exactly like "Smoke"—hot, opaque, and voluminous, colored in deep oranges, reds, and shadowy greys.
The Action: Gravity is beginning to pull this smoke together. Bright nodes of light (Proto-Stars) are just beginning to ignite within the dense haze, visualizing the command to "Come into being."
Negative Space (Right): The swirling cosmic smoke fades seamlessly to the right into a deep, clean Nebular Vignette, creating a dark canvas for the text.
(2) Text Hierarchy (Right Side - Floating in Negative Space):
The text is aligned LEFT within the right-hand negative space using premium editorial typography.

READ FIRST (Top - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):"THE COSMIC SMOKE CODE"
READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):"Surah 41:11 ('While it was Smoke')"
READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Cosmological State):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Primordial Ember Orange:
"• Verse describes the early Heaven as [Dukhan] (Smoke)."
"• Accurately distinguishes hot gas from cold 'clouds'."
"• Matches the [Opaque Era] of the early universe."
"• Cosmic Smoke (Hot Gas) is the [Origin] of all stars."
"• Gravity compelled the gas to [Condense] and form galaxies."
THE FOOTER (Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:"SCIENTIFIC STATUS: ACCURATE COSMOLOGICAL STATE"
(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K documentary quality, incredibly sharp typography, volumetric lighting (light beams cutting through smoke), luxurious contrast between the glowing gas and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
