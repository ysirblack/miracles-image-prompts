(1) The Wide Split Layout:
A sophisticated cinematic composition divided sharply down the center.

LEFT SIDE: A conceptual, high-fidelity visualization of Mathematical Reflection. Two towering, monolithic glass pillars stand on a reflective surface in a void.
The Left Pillar (representing Long Chapters) glows Gold and displays the ratio "27 / 30".
The Right Pillar (representing Short Chapters) glows Silver and displays the inverted ratio "30 / 27".
Between them is a sharp, illuminated gap labeled "The Missing 39".
RIGHT SIDE: A clean, matte Deep Obsidian background.
(2) Right Panel Text & Hierarchy:
The text is aligned LEFT within the right panel using premium editorial typography.

READ FIRST (Top Right - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):"THE PARITY MIRROR"
READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):"Long vs. Short Surahs (The 27/30 Swap)"
READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Verified):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Reflective Chrome:
"• Divide Quran by Length: [Long] (≥40) vs [Short] (<40)."
"• Result: Exactly [57 Long] and [57 Short] chapters."
"• Long Group Parity: [27 Odd] / [30 Even]."
"• Short Group Parity: [30 Odd] / [27 Even] (Perfect Swap)."
"• Why split at 40? Because NO Surah has exactly [39] verses."
THE FOOTER (Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:"STATISTICAL STATUS: PERFECT SYMMETRICAL INVERSION"
(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K documentary quality, incredibly sharp typography, glass and reflection lighting, luxurious contrast between the pillars and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
