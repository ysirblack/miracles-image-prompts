Prompt: aspect_ratio="16:9"
(1) The Wide Layout:
A single, cohesive 16:9 cinematic shot.

Visual Anchor (Left): A haunting, high-fidelity scientific visualization of the Death of the Sun.
The Sun: It is no longer bright yellow, but a dying, deep red/brown orb that is visibly shrinking and collapsing inward.
The Action: Dark, smoky nebular clouds are "wrapping" around it (visualizing Kuwwirat), swirling like a shroud as its light is extinguished.
Background: The surrounding stars are noticeably dimming or "falling" from the sky, creating a sense of cosmic entropy.
Negative Space (Right): The darkening cosmos fades seamlessly to the right into a deep, absolute Entropy Void, creating a pitch-black canvas for the text.
(2) Text Hierarchy (Right Side - Floating in Negative Space):
The text is aligned LEFT within the right-hand negative space using premium editorial typography.

READ FIRST (Top - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):"THE DEATH OF THE SUN"
READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):"Surah 81:1 ('Kuwwirat' - Wrapped/Folded Up)"
READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Stellar Evolution):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Dying Ember Red:
"• Verse 81:1 describes the Sun being [Wrapped/Coiled] up."

"• Matches the final stage of a Star: Collapse into a [White Dwarf]."
"• Verse 81:2 describes Stars [Losing Luster] (Inkadarat)."

THE FOOTER (Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:"SCIENTIFIC STATUS: ACCURATE STELLAR EVOLUTION MODEL"
(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K documentary quality, incredibly sharp typography, ominous low-key lighting, luxurious contrast between the dying ember and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
