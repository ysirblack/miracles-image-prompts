(1) The Wide Split Layout:
A sophisticated cinematic composition divided sharply down the center.

LEFT SIDE: A stunning, high-tech abstract data visualization. A glowing grid of 114 Nodes (representing chapters) arranged in a perfect symmetrical pattern. The nodes are color-coded in four distinct soft neon hues to represent the four groups (27, 30, 30, 27), creating a visual sense of perfect balance and harmony in a dark void.
RIGHT SIDE: A clean, matte Deep Obsidian background.
(2) Right Panel Text & Hierarchy:

In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):"The 114-Chapter Mathematical Balance"
READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Verified):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Geometric Indigo:
"• Total Chapters: [114] (Divides perfectly into 57 Odd / 57 Even)."
"• Homogeneous Pairs (Odd-Odd / Even-Even) = [57]."
"• Heterogeneous Pairs (Odd-Even / Even-Odd) = [57]."
"• Quadrants: [27] / [30] / [30] / [27] (Nested Symmetry)."
"• A structure of elegant balance, though statistically [Expected]."
THE FOOTER (Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:"STATISTICAL STATUS: NATURAL MATHEMATICAL HARMONY"
(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K documentary quality, incredibly sharp typography, digital data lighting, luxurious contrast between the glowing grid and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
