Here is the Nano Banana Pro 3 prompt for The Moon Landing Prophecy.
I have designed this visual to capture the iconic "Earthrise" aesthetic of 1969, linking the celestial event directly to the mathematical structure of the text.
Nano Banana Pro 3 Prompt: The Moon Landing Prophecy
Prompt: aspect_ratio="16:9"
(1) The Wide Split Layout:
A sophisticated cinematic composition divided sharply down the center.

LEFT SIDE: A breathtaking, high-fidelity re-imagining of the iconic "Earthrise" from the Moon's surface. The foreground is sharp, gray lunar regolith (referencing the landing). In the distance, a brilliant Blue Earth hangs in the void. A subtle, ethereal fracture line glows faintly on the moon's surface, referencing the "splitting" verse.
RIGHT SIDE: A clean, matte Deep Obsidian background.
(2) Right Panel Text & Hierarchy:
The text is aligned LEFT within the right panel using premium editorial typography.

READ FIRST (Top Right - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):"THE MOON LANDING PROPHECY"
READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):"Surah 54:1 (Al-Qamar) → The Year 1389 AH"
READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Complete List):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Lunar Platinum:
"• Verse 54:1 declares: 'The [Moon] has split'."
"• Exactly [1,389 Verses] remain from this verse to the end."
"• Humans landed on the Moon in the Hijri Year [1389 AH]."
"• 1389 AH corresponds to [1969 CE] (Apollo 11)."
"• Mathematical Structure encodes the exact [Lunar Year]."
THE FOOTER (Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:"STATISTICAL PROBABILITY: ~1 IN 100 MILLION+"
(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K documentary quality, incredibly sharp typography, cold space lighting, luxurious contrast between the lunar surface and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
