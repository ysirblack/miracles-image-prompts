(1) The Wide Split Layout:
A sophisticated cinematic composition divided sharply down the center.

LEFT SIDE: A mesmerizing, abstract 3D visualization of Mathematical Harmony. Two glowing streams of digital numbers—one [Gold] (representing Even sums) and one [Silver] (representing Odd sums)—spiral around each other like a Double Helix, ascending into a void. They look like a "code" holding a structure together.
RIGHT SIDE: A clean, matte Deep Obsidian background.

"• Result: Exactly [57 Even] sums and [57 Odd] sums."
"• Total of Even Group = [6,236] (Exact Total of Quran Verses)."
"• Total of Odd Group = [6,555] (Sum of Surah #'s 1-114)."
"• A perfect mathematical checksum of the entire book."
THE FOOTER (Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:"STATISTICAL PROBABILITY: ~1 IN 833 (0.12%)"
(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K documentary quality, incredibly sharp typography, elegant data visualization lighting, luxurious contrast between the spiral code and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
