(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A dramatic, high-contrast macro shot of Red-Hot Iron on a forge. It is in the state of being "made pliable"—glowing intense orange-white and emitting sparks.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The industrial glow fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the metal).

"THE IRON THERMAL CODE"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Surah 17:50 → 34:10 (Melting Point)"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Verified):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Forge Fire Orange:

"• Path A (Melting): [1st Iron Verse] to ['Pliable' Verse] = [1,538 Verses]."

"• Exact Match: Iron Melting Point is [1,538°C]."

"• Path B (Boiling): ['Iron+Fire' Verse] to [Last Verse] = [2,862 Verses]."

"• Exact Match: Iron Boiling Point is [2,862°C]."

"• Verse 34:10 specifically mentions making iron [Pliable]."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"STATISTICAL PROBABILITY: ~1 IN 100 MILLION+"

Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, industrial "heat" lighting, luxurious contrast between the glowing metal and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.s
