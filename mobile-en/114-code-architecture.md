Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A breathtaking, complex 3D Holographic Blueprint floating in a void. It consists of 114 Glowing Nodes arranged in a spherical lattice. Layers of Gold, Blue, and Silver lines visualize the interlocking patterns (Parity, Blocks, Sums) forming an unbreakable digital lock.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The holographic lattice fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the blueprint).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE 114-CODE ARCHITECTURE"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Five Interlocking Numerical Layers"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Complete List):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Holographic Prism Colors:

"• Layer 1: [Core Parity] (27/30/30/27 Symmetry)."

"• Layer 2: [Even-Sum] (Matches 6,236 Verse Total)."

"• Layer 3: [Long/Short Swap] (Perfect Mirror)."

"• Layer 4: [Six-Block Symphony] (Alternating Rhythm)."

"• Layer 5: [Verse-Number Mirror] (Filtered Swap)."

"• Combined Status: A [Multi-Dimensional] Mathematical Lock."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"THEORETICAL COMBINED PROBABILITY: ~1 IN 595 BILLION"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, "Master Code" lighting, luxurious contrast between the complex hologram and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
