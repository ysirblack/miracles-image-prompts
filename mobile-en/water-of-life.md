(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A breathtaking, high-fidelity microscopic visualization of a Living Cell. Inside the translucent membrane, the Cytoplasm glows with fluid motion, showing streams of H₂O Molecules fueling biological machinery. It looks like a "Universe in a Drop."

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The fluid environment fades downwards into a clean, deep Aquatic/Abyssal Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Surah 21:30: 'And We made from water every living thing...'"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Biological Basis):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Aqua Pure Blue:

"• Biological Fact: Cytoplasm is [80% Water]."

"• Water is the [Universal Solvent] for biochemistry."

"• No known organism exists without [Liquid Water]."

"• NASA's exobiology motto: '[Follow the Water]'."

"• Validates the fundamental [Axiom of Life]."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"SCIENTIFIC STATUS: UNIVERSAL BIOLOGICAL AXIOM"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, macro biological lighting, luxurious contrast between the glowing fluid and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
