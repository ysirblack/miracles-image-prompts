Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A high-fidelity scientific visualization of "Structured Genesis." Rising from raw Clay/Earth (Turab/Tin) at the base of the visual section is a glowing Hexagonal Lattice (Carbon structure). Inside the hexagons, DNA strands begin to form, bridging matter to life.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The geometric lattice fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the lattice).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE CARBON × CREATION CODE"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Atomic Constants & Biological Architecture"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Exact Matches):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Carbon-Life Green:

"• Creation uses exactly [6 Material Labels] (Matches Carbon Atomic #6)."

"• Word 'Tin' (Clay) appears exactly [12] times (Matches Carbon Mass #12)."

"• Verse Spans reveal a [C-12 Track] (Multiples: 12, 24, 60, 120...)."

"• Bio-Lane: Spans encode [23/46] (Chromosomes) & [64] (Codons)."

"• Signature: 'Breath' to 'Breath' (Nefha) span is exactly [23 x 23]."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"STATISTICAL PROBABILITY: VANISHINGLY SMALL (POISSON TAIL < 10⁻⁷)"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, "Intelligent Design" lighting, luxurious contrast between the geometric lattice and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
