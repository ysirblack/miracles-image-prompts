Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A mesmerizing, abstract 3D visualization of Mathematical Harmony. Two glowing streams of digital numbers—one [Gold] (Even sums) and one [Silver] (Odd sums)—spiral around each other like a Double Helix, ascending into a void.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The spiral code fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the helix).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE EVEN-SUM SYMPHONY"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"The Dual Accounting System (Surah # + Verses)"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Verified):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Harmonic Gold:

"• Add [Surah Number] + [Verse Count] for all 114 chapters."

"• Result: Exactly [57 Even] sums and [57 Odd] sums."

"• Total of Even Group = [6,236] (Exact Total of Quran Verses)."

"• Total of Odd Group = [6,555] (Sum of Surah #'s 1-114)."

"• A perfect mathematical checksum of the entire book."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"STATISTICAL PROBABILITY: ~1 IN 833 (0.12%)"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, elegant data visualization lighting, luxurious contrast between the spiral code and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
