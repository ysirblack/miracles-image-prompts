(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A magnificent, high-fidelity 3D cross-section of Planet Earth. The crust and mantle are cut away to reveal the glowing orange outer core and a bright, solid Iron Inner Core at the center. A depth marker labeled "5,100 km" points to the boundary.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The geological layers fade seamlessly downwards into a deep, clean Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the Earth image).
