Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A spectacular geological cross-section of a Mountain Range. Snow-capped peaks rise above, while massive, deep Mountain Roots extend far down into the glowing mantle, resembling a "Peg" or "Tooth."

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The subterranean rock fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the geological section).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE MOUNTAIN ROOTS CODE"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Surah 78:6-7: 'Have We not made... the mountains as pegs?'"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Geological Isostasy):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Granite Grey/Gold:

"• Verse describes Mountains as [Awtad] (Pegs/Stakes)."

"• A Tent Peg is mostly buried [Underground] to hold firm."

"• Geology confirms Mountains have deep [Roots] in the Mantle."

"• Roots can be [15x Deeper] than the visible height."

"• This phenomenon (Isostasy) [Stabilizes] the Earth's crust."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"SCIENTIFIC STATUS: CONFIRMED GEOLOGICAL ISOSTASY"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, geological cross-section lighting, luxurious contrast between the layered earth and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
