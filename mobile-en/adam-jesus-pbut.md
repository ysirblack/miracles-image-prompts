Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A conceptual, high-fidelity visualization of Divine Similitude. A vertical mirror interface divides two textures: Red Clay (Adam) on the left and White Light (Jesus) on the right. Glowing lines connect "Adam" to "Surah 3" and "Jesus" to "Surah 4", meeting at "Surah 25".

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The textures fade downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the visual).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE ADAM & JESUS BALANCE"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Similarity in Creation (Surah 3:59)"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Structural Depth):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Balanced Amethyst:

"• Names 'Adam' & 'Jesus' appear exactly [25] times each."

"• Adam (3 Letters) -> Surah [3] (Family of Imran/Adam)."

"• Jesus (4 Letters) -> Surah [4] (The Women/Virgin Birth)."

"• Surah [25] (Al-Furqan) has exactly [77] Verses (Sum of 3+4)."

"• Verse 25:7 ('Eating Food') ↔ [Adam] (Human Nature)."

"• Verse 25:25 ('Heaven Split') ↔ [Jesus] (Ascended Nature)."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"STATISTICAL PROBABILITY: ~1 IN 18,800 (EXACT TIE)"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, dual-texture lighting (Earthen vs Ethereal), luxurious contrast, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
