Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A dramatic, high-fidelity historical visualization of the Byzantine Counter-Offensive. Roman Legions rally at dawn in a desert canyon, with tattered purple banners catching the rising sun. A glowing timeline arc marks "615 CE (Defeat)" to "627 CE (Victory)."

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The desert landscape fades downwards into a clean, deep Historical Vignette, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the legions).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE ROMAN VICTORY PROPHECY"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Surah 30:2-4 ('Within a Few Years')"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Historical Impossibility):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Imperial Purple:

"• Quran predicted Roman victory immediately after [Total Defeat]."

"• Arabic term 'Bid'' specifies a range of [3 to 9 Years]."

"• Historians confirm the Empire was [Collapsing] at the time."

"• Victory seemed [Impossible] to all contemporary observers."

"• Fulfilled exactly [7-9 Years] later at Nineveh (627 CE)."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"HISTORICAL STATUS: VERIFIED FULFILLED PROPHECY"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, dawn "turning tide" lighting, luxurious contrast between the historical scene and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
