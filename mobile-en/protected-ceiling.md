Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A spectacular scientific visualization of Earth's Magnetosphere. A glowing Blue Magnetic Shield surrounds Earth, actively deflecting a stream of Burning Orange Solar Wind. It visually looks like a "Ceiling" protecting the world.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The solar wind fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the magnetic field).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE PROTECTED CEILING"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Surah 21:32: 'And We made the sky a protected ceiling...'"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Dual Shielding):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Shield Cyan:

"• Verse calls the Sky a [Protected Ceiling]."

"• [Atmosphere]: Filters UV rays and burns meteors."

"• [Magnetosphere]: Deflects lethal Solar Wind."

"• Van Allen Belts act as an invisible [Force Field]."

"• Without this shield, life on Earth would be [Impossible]."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"SCIENTIFIC STATUS: CONFIRMED PLANETARY SHIELDING"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, high-contrast lighting (Orange Solar Wind vs Blue Magnetic Field), luxurious aesthetic.
