Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A stunning, high-fidelity oceanographic cross-section showing Waves upon Waves. Surface waves rage at the top, while deep underwater, a massive Internal Wave undulates at the density barrier, transitioning into abyssal darkness.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The deep water darkness fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the ocean section).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE INTERNAL WAVES CODE"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Surah 24:40: '...darknesses within a deep sea covered by waves...'"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Oceanographic Depth):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Deep Abyssal Blue:

"• Verse describes a deep sea covered by [Waves upon Waves]."

"• Matches [Internal Waves]: Massive waves hidden deep underwater."

"• They occur at the [Pycnocline] (Density Interface)."

"• Describes [Layered Darkness] where light disappears."

"• Below 1000m, visibility is [Zero] ('Hardly see his hand')."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"SCIENTIFIC STATUS: CONFIRMED FLUID DYNAMICS"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, stormy aquatic lighting, luxurious contrast between the turbulent water and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
