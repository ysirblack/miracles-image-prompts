(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A breathtaking celestial composite visualizing Cosmic Synchronization. In the upper left, the Sun burns in [Deep Gold] with a "365" ring. In the lower right, the Moon glows in [Cool Silver] with a "354" ring. The orbits intersect to visualize the 11-day cycle difference.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The cosmic background fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.
