Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A conceptual, high-fidelity visualization of Perfect Equilibrium. A majestic, ancient Golden Scale is suspended in a dark void. The Left Pan holds a glowing orb (Titles/Rasul), and the Right Pan holds a matching orb (Names). The needle is perfectly centered.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The scale fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the scale).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE PROPHET BALANCE"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Total 'Messenger' Nouns vs. Total 'Prophet' Names"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Verified):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Balanced Emerald Green:

"• Total 'Messenger' Nouns (People/Titles) = [510]."

"• Total 'Prophet' Names (Adam to Muhammad) = [510]."

"• The Ratio is exactly [1:1] across the entire text."

"• Methodology: [Noun-to-Noun] / [People-to-People]."

"• Excludes 'Messages' (Things) and 'Ahmad' (Duplicate Name)."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"STATISTICAL CONVERGENCE: PERFECT NUMERICAL SYMMETRY"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, symmetrical lighting, luxurious contrast between the gold scale and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
