Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A conceptual, high-fidelity visualization of "The Unanswered Pen." An exquisite Arabic Calligraphy Pen (Qalam) rests on a stand under dramatic light. A single drop of golden ink hangs frozen from the tip, symbolizing the inability to write a response.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The scene fades downwards into a clean, deep Library/Study Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the pen).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE LITERARY CHALLENGE"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Surah 2:23 ('Produce a Surah like it')"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Linguistic Uniqueness):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Inkwell Gold:

"• Verse 2:23 challenges humanity to write [One Chapter] like it."

"• 7th Century Arabs were [Masters] of poetry and language."

"• The Quran introduced a [Unique Genre] breaking all metric rules."

"• It is neither Poetry (Shi'r) nor Prose (Saj')."

"• Despite the challenge, history records [Zero] successful rivals."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"HISTORICAL STATUS: AN UNANSWERED 1,400-YEAR CHALLENGE"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, dramatic "spotlight" lighting, luxurious contrast between the glowing text and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
