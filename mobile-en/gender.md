Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A conceptual visualization of Linguistic Equilibrium. Suspended in a dark void are two glowing Arabic words: "رَجُل" (Man) in [Cyan] and "ٱمْرَأَة" (Woman) in [Magenta]. They are positioned at the exact same height, perfectly balanced.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The glowing text fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the calligraphy).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE GENDER BALANCE CODE"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Singular Terminology: Man & Woman"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Verified):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Balanced Violet:

"• Singular word 'Man' (Rajul) appears exactly [26] times."

"• Singular word 'Woman' (Imra'ah) appears exactly [26] times."

"• A Perfect [26:26] Linguistic Balance."

"• Represents [Gender Equality] in terminology."

"• Method: Counts all singular tokens without adjustment."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"STATISTICAL STATUS: ~11% PROBABILITY (NATURAL SYMMETRY)"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, studio portrait lighting, luxurious contrast between the glowing text and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
