Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A blindingly majestic, high-fidelity scientific visualization of the Sun's Photosphere. It is bright, intense Golden-White (representing high temperature), positioned very high in the frame with spectral lines overlaying the surface.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The intense heat light fades quickly downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the visual).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE SUN TEMPERATURE CODE"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"From First Mention (2:258) → Last Mention (91:1)"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Complete List):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Intense Kelvin Gold:

"• The 'Sun Envelope': Counts from the [First] to the [Last] mention."

"• The Verse Count is exactly [5,778 Verses]."

"• Sun's Effective Temperature is [5,778 Kelvin] (NASA Std)."

"• Perfect Match: [±0] deviation."

"• Spans [89 Surahs], locking the structure of the entire book."

"• 7th Century: No [Kelvin], No [Spectroscopy], No [Physics]."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"STATISTICAL PROBABILITY: ~1 IN 10 MILLION+"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, bright "heat" lighting radiating from the top, luxurious contrast, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
