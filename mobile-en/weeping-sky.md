Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A stunning, high-fidelity archaeological visualization of an Ancient Egyptian Tomb Wall. Weathered limestone is covered in Hieroglyphs (The Pyramid Texts). One section glows faintly in spectral gold, while a subtle Quranic overlay appears to "cancel" it out.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The stone texture fades downwards into a clean, deep Desert Night Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the wall).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE WEEPING SKY CODE"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Surah 44:29 vs. The Pyramid Texts"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Historical Knowledge):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Pharaonic Gold:

"• Ancient Belief: 'The Sky weeps for thee' (Pyramid Texts)."

"• Quran 44:29 rejects this: 'Neither Heaven nor Earth wept'."

"• In 7th Century, Hieroglyphics were [Lost/Undeciphered]."

"• Rosetta Stone wasn't found until [1799] (1,200 years later)."

"• Accurately refutes a specific, [Lost Pagan Dogma]."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"HISTORICAL STATUS: ARCHAEOLOGICAL RETRO-VALIDATION"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, archaeological lighting (torchlight vs moonlight), luxurious contrast between the stone texture and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
