Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A high-tech, 3D scientific visualization of an Iron Atom. The nucleus glows with [26 Protons] and [31 Neutrons], surrounded by orbiting electron shells against a faint starfield.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The atomic glow fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the atom).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE IRON ATOMIC CODE"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Surah 57 (Al-Hadid): The Central Chapter"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Complete List):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Atomic Neon Blue:

"• Surah [57] matches Iron Isotope [Fe-57] (Mass Number)."

"• Abjad Value of 'Hadid' is [26] (Matches 26 Protons)."

"• Abjad Value of 'Al-Hadid' is [57] (Matches Isotope)."

"• Surah 57 is the [Exact Center] of the Quran (Center of Earth)."

"• Verse 57:25 explicitly states Iron was [Sent Down]."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"STATISTICAL PROBABILITY: ~1 IN 100 MILLION+"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, scientific laboratory lighting, luxurious contrast between the glowing atom and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
