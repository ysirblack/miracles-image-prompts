Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A stunning, high-fidelity visualization of the Golden Ratio ($\phi$). A glowing Nautilus Shell or Fibonacci Spiral constructed of golden light. The number 1.618... overlays the spiral, with decimals trailing off into infinity.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The spiral geometry fades downwards into a clean, deep Mathematical Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the spiral).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE GOLDEN RATIO CODE"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Surah 16:18 (The Uncountable Infinite)"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Mathematical Infinity):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Phi Golden Ratio:

"• The Golden Ratio ($\phi$) is approx [1.618]."

"• Verse [16:18] states: 'If you try to count... you cannot'."

"• Phi is an [Irrational Number] with infinite decimals."

"• It is mathematically impossible to [Enumerate] the end of Phi."

"• The Verse content matches the [Infinite Nature] of the number."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"STATISTICAL STATUS: PERFECT NUMERICAL & SEMANTIC ALIGNMENT"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, "Divine Proportion" lighting, luxurious contrast between the glowing geometry and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
