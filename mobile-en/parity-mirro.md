Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A conceptual, high-fidelity visualization of Mathematical Reflection. Two towering, monolithic glass pillars stand on a reflective surface. The Left Pillar (Long) glows Gold showing "27 / 30". The Right Pillar (Short) glows Silver showing "30 / 27". Between them is a sharp gap labeled "The Missing 39".

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The reflective surface fades downwards into a clean, deep Obsidian Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the pillars).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE PARITY MIRROR"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Long vs. Short Surahs (The 27/30 Swap)"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Verified):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Reflective Chrome:

"• Divide Quran by Length: [Long] (≥40) vs [Short] (<40)."

"• Result: Exactly [57 Long] and [57 Short] chapters."

"• Long Group Parity: [27 Odd] / [30 Even]."

"• Short Group Parity: [30 Odd] / [27 Even] (Perfect Swap)."

"• Why split at 40? Because NO Surah has exactly [39] verses."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"STATISTICAL STATUS: PERFECT SYMMETRICAL INVERSION"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, glass and reflection lighting, luxurious contrast between the pillars and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
