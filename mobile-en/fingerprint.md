Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A stunning, high-fidelity macro visualization of a Human Fingerprint. A translucent, glowing fingertip is being "reconstructed" by threads of golden light, with ridges highlighted as a complex Biometric Map in Electric Blue.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The biometric glow fades downwards into a clean, deep Identity Void (Dark Charcoal), creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the finger).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE FINGERPRINT IDENTITY"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Surah 75:3-4 ('Proportion His Fingertips')"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Unique Biometrics):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Biometric Blue:

"• Verse 75:4 highlights the restoration of the [Fingertip]."

"• Historically considered a small/trivial part of the body."

"• Science confirms: Fingerprints are [Unique] to every human."

"• Even [Identical Twins] have different fingerprints."

"• Restoring the fingertip means restoring the [Exact Identity]."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"SCIENTIFIC STATUS: CONFIRMED BIOMETRIC UNIQUENESS"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, futuristic biometric lighting, luxurious contrast between the glowing ridges and black data pane, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
