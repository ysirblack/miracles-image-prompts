Prompt: aspect_ratio="9:16"

(1) The Vertical Layout (30/70 Split):
A single, cohesive 9:16 cinematic vertical shot.

Visual Anchor (Top 30%): A stunning high-fidelity scientific visualization showing a triptych (three-stage sequence) of Human Embryonic Development. From left to right: The 'Alaqah (Suspended Clot), the Mudghah (Chewed Substance with somites), and the forming Bones.

Negative Space (Bottom 70%): The biological environment fades downwards into a clean, deep Medical Void, creating a massive dark canvas below.

(2) Text Hierarchy (Bottom 70% - Top Aligned):
The text is aligned LEFT and anchored to the TOP of the bottom section (starts immediately below the embryo sequence).

READ FIRST (Top of Text Block - Headline):
In massive, elegant, high-end Modern Serif font (Pure White):
"THE HUMAN STAGES CODE"

READ SECOND (Below Headline - The Bridge):
In a refined, lighter weight italic Serif font (Silver/Grey):
"Surah 23:12-14 (Chronology of Creation)"

READ LAST (The Narrative Evidence - Precise Progression):
A bold, legible list of succinct facts using a sophisticated sans-serif font. Key numbers are accented in Life-Blood Red:

"• Verses describe the exact chronological order of development."

"• Stage ['Alaqah]: Suspended, clot-like structure (Days 15-24)."

"• Stage [Mudghah]: 'Chewed-like' appearance due to somites (Days 24-26)."

"• Stage ['Izam/Lahm]: Bones form before being clothed in flesh."

"• Matches the established sequence in modern embryology."

THE FOOTER (Very Bottom Edge):
Separated by a thin line, in small caps:
"SCIENTIFIC STATUS: ACCURATE DEVELOPMENTAL CHRONOLOGY"

(3) Atmosphere:
Premium 4K vertical poster quality, incredibly sharp typography, soft biological lighting, luxurious contrast, clean and sophisticated aesthetic.
